## VR Market Research

### Teleportation Mechanics
Most VR games seem to have a basic instant point and click teleporting mechanic. <br/>
My initial idea was to have a preview window of the view from the position you are about to teleport to. <br/>
During my initial market research I discovered a game called Budget Cuts that already has this mechanic. <br/>

However, now I know that this mechanic can work, I am thinking of having other options attached to this idea. For example, I think an interesting idea would be having different teleports that also change the scale of the player after they teleport, perhaps shrinking or expanding the size of the player. I could also do this for any objects that the player is carrying. This could be an interesting mechanic for puzzle games. <br/>
