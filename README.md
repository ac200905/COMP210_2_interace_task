## VR Market Research

### Teleportation Mechanics
Most VR games seem to have a basic instant point and click teleporting mechanic. <br/>
My initial idea was to have a preview window of the view from the position you are about to teleport to. <br/>
During my initial market research I discovered a game called Budget Cuts that already has this mechanic. <br/>

However, now I know that this mechanic can work, I am thinking of having other options attached to this idea. For example, I think an interesting idea would be having different teleports that also change the scale of the player after they teleport, perhaps shrinking or expanding the size of the player. In Waltz of the Wizard there is a spell that turns the player into a giant <br/>

I could also do this for any objects that the player is carrying. The resizing of objects could be an interesting mechanic for a puzzle game. Reminiscent of the ideas in Ant-Man. <br/>
